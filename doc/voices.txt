Information on Quionton and voices. When running any commands, omit the backticks
-----

Quinton does TTS using Espeak, and can use a variety of voices. While Espeak comes with a good amount of pre-installed voices,
you can also install Mbrola voices if you want.

Finding a voice
-----

To get a list of the default voices Espeak offers, open a command prompt and type:
`espeak --voices`

To get a list of voices in a certain language, type:
`espeak --voices={language code}`
Ex. `espeak --voices=en` for English

Note that this will also display all of the usable Mbrola voices for that language, even if you don't have them installed.

Setting the voice:
-----

1. Open `../data/config/config.yaml` with your favorite text editor. If you are in the base directory, go to `data/config/config.yaml`.
2. Go to Document 3
3. Set the value of `voice` to the name (full or abbriviated) of the voice you've selected
4. Save and exit

Installing Mbrola voices:
-----

Because I use a Debian-based system, I will be using apt-get. Be sure to use the correct package manager/installer for your distribution. 

1. Run `sudo apt-get install mbrola-{voice name}`.
   Ex. `sudo apt-get install mbrola-us2`

   For a complete list of voice names, see the espeak voices database on GitHub (https://github.com/numediart/MBROLA-voices), or if you use bash, 
   use the autocomplete to give you a readout. Typing `sudo apt-get install mbr` and then hitting `tab` worked for me. NOTE: I tried the same thing 
   on fish, dash, and rbash and none of them had the same capability that bash did (at least for me).

2. Test the voice in Espeak with `espeak -v mb-{voice name} "{Text to speak}"`
   Ex. `espeak -v mb-us2 "Hello, World"`

3. To set it as Quinton's voice, follow the steps above
